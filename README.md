Module 6
this code creates an object called 'Item' with two members name and quantity with data type string for name and int for quatity
we used saveToFile()' to write the item data to a file To do that we included a library called <fstream> and we named that that file items.txt
And loadFromFile() to read the data back from the file and display it 

then in our main () an item object is created and values are assigned ,and that is were our  file functions are called  then saves item info into a file and then reads it back 

-->Module 11 
This one creates an object called product with private attributes (id, name,and price)
then when the object is created the constructor runs and prints a message 
and  then the  destructor prints a message when the object is destroyed
